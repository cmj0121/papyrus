# RevDB

> The crawler friendly storage

RevDB is the backend storage for crawler and keep the data into the persistent storage.
It provides the revision for the data and the data can be tracked by the revision per each
primary key.

RevDB is based on Papyrus as the lower-end storage, wrapping the Papyrus and provide the
revision based storage.

### Concept

Each data in RevDB contains the 128-bit unique ID (UID). It is generated by the RevDB
and cannot be changed. User upload the data with the sortable and searchable _Key_ as the
primary key and arbitrary data as the _Value_.

User can upload multiple times with the same Key with different Value, even delete the
data with the same Key. RevDB will keep the data with the revision, with the different
UID and show the latest data as the default behavior. At the same time, RevDB provides
the interface to query all the revisions of the data with the same Key.
